# Abdirisak Mohamed

I'm a full stack developer who loves nothing more than turning code into beautiful, functional websites that solve real problems for people.
I've got a sharp eye for design and a passion for writing clean, efficient code.
My toolbox is packed with all the latest tech, including Typescript, Nextjs, React Native, and Node.js, and I'm never happier than when I'm tinkering with a new database (especially MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL).
I'm a problem-solver at heart and I enjoy nothing more than digging into a tricky issue to find a creative solution. And when it all comes together in a seamless, intuitive user experience? Pure magic.
I can't wait to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a fast-paced, dynamic work environment and tackle some exciting new projects!
